# Humanities Art and Social Sciences
In the new curriculum change at IST, there was the introduction of HASS.
We were given a choice among several subjects pertaining to Humanities Art and Social Sciences

I choose **City Management: Challenges and Conflicts**
In the first part of the semester we researched a borough and in the second part we studied conflicts and their resolution

3rd Year, 1st Semester
