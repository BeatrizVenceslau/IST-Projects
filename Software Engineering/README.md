Upgrading [Quizzes Tutor](https://quizzes-tutor.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) by adding 3 new features.

We worked in a group of 6, sub devided in 3 sub-groups of two - one for each feature.

The project was developed with the help of github for project management with Projects, Issues and the quality of Pull Requests and Commits being subject to evaluation.

The 3 features were:

  **Open Ended Questions**
  - *Goal:* Support Open Ended Questions, in witch correction is made by comparisson with the answer inserted by the teacher.

  **Multiple Choice Questions**
  - *Goal:* Extend current Multiple Choice Questions so there can be more than 1 correct answer, and the correct answers can be ordered by relevance.
  
  **Item Combination Questions (My Subgroup)**
  - *Goal:* Support Item Combination Questions in witch given 2 groups of items they can be related two by two. One item can be related with several other items , but does not need to be related at all.
