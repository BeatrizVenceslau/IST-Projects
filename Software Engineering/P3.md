#### Rationale
End-to-End tests are defined for the common use cases to test the code from beginning to end, to check that the code runs as expected, making sure that the subsystems work well together, since a problem in one could mean the whole system fails.
The tests are made from the point of view of the user to simulate a real scenario of a person using the final product.
End-to-End testing brings benefits since it reduces the number of bugs present in the code and ensures the code runs correctly.

#### Commands defined
